# Money Ball

The purpose of this assignment was to put together an all-time best roster of cheap
players who had great on base percentages.

The primary goal was to find the players who would produce the highest
percentage of getting on base, per dollar of investment(ie. salary)

On base percentage has been determined to be a better measurement of a player's
contribution to the success of the team.

After completing this assignment, one will be versed in understanding how to use
public data for analysis; how to relate many databases and perform analysis on the
related data; publish data analysis as a notebook; Join/Merge external databases;
perform statistical analysis; and present the findings in a professional notebook.

The data used for this assignment comes from Sean Lahman's website; the most recent
complete baseball statistics dataset.
